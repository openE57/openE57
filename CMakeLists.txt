# Requirements: 
# * Xerces library: http://xerces.apache.org/ 
# * Boost library: http://www.boost.org
#
# Notes: Since there is not standard cmake module to find the xerces library we
# provide one with this distribution. It should be able to find the library from
# the XERCES_ROOT cmake variable. Standard layout, as with the binary packages
# from apache is assumed. If you find any errors or have suggestion to improve
# the build script: patches are most welcome!
